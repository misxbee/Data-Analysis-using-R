Project Title: Movies R Us Data Analysis

Objective:
As part of the Data science , this project aim to unlock valuable insights within our extensive Movie Ratings and Movie Extended Dataset.
This research delves into the specifics of movie ratings, offering in-depth analysis beyond numerical evaluations.
Additionally, the study validates movie budgets and explores profit analysis across various categories.
Movies R Us embraces cutting-edge technology to enhance data analytics, ensuring personalized content, real-time processing, and robust structured and unstructured data analysis.

Key Features:

Portfolio Component 3: Solving Data Science Problem 

Part 1 - Exploring the Data:
The data is carefully generated through some simple tests in R and  the following tasks has been fulfilled. For the following tasks,
you must write code and generate graphs (at least one graph for tasks 2-6).
1. Explore your dataset (using str, nrow etc.) and explain your understanding.
2. How Genre impacts the budget of the movie?
3. Is there any relation between the critic rating and the budget?
4. Is there any relationship between the audience ratings and the budget?
5. Show the correlation between audience and critic ratings has evolved throughout the
years by movie genre. (Request from the CEO)
6. Create a graph to show the number of films from the dataset categorised by Genre.

Part 2 - Advanced Analytics:

In next part, an extended Movie data set is used. The dataset contains more columns than the previous one. Using this new data set,
the following tasks has been fulfilled.

For the following tasks, you must write code and generate graphs (at least one graph for
tasks 1-5).

1. They give you the following graph image as the R code is not found and they would like
to remove the spelling mistake in the Graph Title and rename the Graph Title “Gross
Percentage By Genre”. You need to recreate the graph by writing R code. You must
use the Grammar of Graphics to recreate the following graph. You must also explain
your code and display the output at each step.
2. Write R code to find the trend of the Day of the week that most/least movies were
released compared to other days.
3. Identify if the profit of a movie depends on any of the features in this data set i.e.
genre, director, profit etc
4. Use ggplot and boxplot to identify if there is an anomaly / any anomalies in the data?
5. Find if there is any further insight you can find from this data set, marks will be
awarded by the number of further useful graphs as well as their complexity.

The explanation of the code and the in depth analysis is mentioned the Data Analysis report-pdf.
